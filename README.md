2019 Electric race D simple circuit characteristics tester

基本部分都已完成，发挥部分除C1加倍外，其他故障判断都可以在2秒内判断出来（C1加倍在低频情况下，输出和输入相位差变化了两度，但采用的AD采集模块采集端口是用杜邦线连接，非SMA，可能因干扰较大，难以准确测试出来，本人将C1加倍测试部分已注释，代码已开源）

Basic parts have been completed, and play a part in addition to the double C1, other fault judgment can be judge in 2 seconds (C1 double under the condition of low frequency, output and input phase change twice, but the AD sampling module port is to use dupont lines to connect, the SMA, may be due to the interference is bigger, it is difficult to accurately test come out, I double C1 test part is annotated, the code is open source)
